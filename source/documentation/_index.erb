# DSS Application Support

## Definition

This document describes the support service Digital Shared Services provides to its customers for applications developed by in-house teams.

It is useful to clearly define a few terms before defining exactly what is meant by *application support*.

### Maintenance

Maintenance is defined as the effort associated with fixing defects in a software system after it has gone into live running (production). These defects may have been known before the application goes into production or discovered after the application has gone into production.

### Enhancements

Enhancements, also known as change requests or feature requests, are defined as the effort associated with adding new capability to a software system, or modifying a software system to meet newly defined non-functional requirements.

### Service requests

Service requests are simple repeatable tasks that are carried out by technical staff on behalf of users of the application because the application does not provide that function to the user.

### Support

Support is defined as the sum of the maintenance, enhancements and service request efforts after the application has gone into production.

## Scope

Support is defined as a range of services provided to the customer that relate directly to the application or system. Support consists of the following services:

- Incident response - general
- Incident response - security
- Data import / export
- Delete data
- Access request
- Backup & restore of data
- Patch and upgrade infrastructure
- Decommission application or service
- Request for advice
- Change request
- New feature request

The ability of DSS to provide support for existing applications is dependent upon the technologies used in those applications. Historically speaking, the NICS has developed applications using a Microsoft based technology stack. Consequently applications constructed with other technology stacks cannot be supported.

In addition, even if the application uses a Microsoft technology stack, we will be limited by the age and supportability of the elements of the stack. Our [Technology Roadmap](#technology-roadmap) is provided below.

## Support Levels

The level of support provided depends upon the age of the application or system and falls into three categories:

- Full support (years 1 to 5)
- Extended support (years 6 to 7)
- Out of support (year 8+)

The services provided at each support level are shown below.

| Service | Full support | Extended support | Out of support |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------------- | -------------- |
| Incident response (general) | Available | Best endeavours<sup>1</sup> | Not available |
| Incident response (security) | Available | Best endeavours<sup>1</sup> | Not available |
| Data import/export | Available | Available | Best endeavours<sup>2</sup> |
| Delete data | Available | Available | Best endeavours<sup>2</sup> |
| Access requests | Available | Available | Best endeavours<sup>2</sup> |
| Backup & restore | Available | Available | Best endeavours<sup>2</sup> |
| Patch and upgrade infrastructure | Available | Available | Best endeavours<sup>2</sup> |
| Decommission system | Available | Available | Best endeavours<sup>2</sup> |
| Request for advice | Available | Available | Available |
| Change request<sup>3</sup> | Available | Not available | Not available |
| New feature request<sup>3</sup> | Available | Not available | Not available |

1. Best endeavours is limited to 5 days. The effort involved in completing the work must be understood and sized within 1 day.
2. Best endeavours work is chargeable when out of support.
3. Change and new feature requests are chargeable.

## Hours of Service

IT Assist Service Desk support hours are 8:00 am to 6:00 pm Monday to Friday excluding Northern Ireland
Public Holidays.

Out of hours support operates between the hours of 6:00 pm and 8:00 am Monday to Friday and over weekends
and public holidays. It is for **emergency fault resolution of key services**. Only authorised staff
within the customers branch will be allowed to use this facility.

The out of hours service operates in a similar manner to the day time service with a main point of contact
or triage, via 0300 1234 155, who will filter, diagnose and allocate the incidents raised to the respective
teams. This incident will be picked up as soon as the building opens the next morning. The on-call staff
member will maintain communication with the customer at all key stages of the process.

## Roles and Responsibilities

DSS responsibilities as a provider of application support are defined as:

- resolution of faults within agreed timescales
- ensuring the level of service adheres to the standards specified in the Service Level Agreement
- advising the customer when faults have been cleared
- giving advice on operating and security procedures
- agreeing a schedule of maintenance, including timescales, with the Customer, to minimize business impact
- compliance with data protection laws in terms of our responsibility as Data Processor
- using best endeavours to notify the customer of a major incident outside normal service hours

The Customer is responsible for:

- informing DSS, in a timely manner, of any policy or operational change which may impact the provision of
the service delivered by DSS
- promptly reporting problems to the IT Assist Service Desk, while ensuring reasonable availability of customer
representatives when resolving a service related incident or request
- ensuring the security or application set up is NOT tampered with on any machine
- initiating accreditation process reviews
- preparing and maintaining the appropriate business cases and ensuring budgetary cover is in place to cover
the costs of application support provided by DSS
- paying the costs associated with application support at agreed intervals

## Costs

The costs associated with supporting an application are attributable to the three elements described above, i.e.

- maintenance
- enhancements
- service requests

The amount of maintenance is directly proportional to the amount of code written i.e. the bigger the system the more it will cost to support. Any changes to a big system as a result of fixing a defect or introducing a change will require a greater effort in retesting to make sure nothing has been broken.

In addition, the introduction of a new application will require changes to the processes and procedures used by first line support staff so that any incident can be correctly routed to the appropriate team for diagnosis and resolution.

DSS currently charges an industry standard of **20% of development costs** for application support. This does not include costs for change requests or feature requests.

## Incident Management

### Reporting

Incidents should be reported to the IT Assist Service Desk on extension 155.

When the incident is logged, the customer will be given a call reference number and the initial priority will be agreed
(where possible) between the Service Desk and the customer.

The Service Desk will assign the call to the apppropriate resolver group within DSS.

### Resolution

The target resolution times for reported incidents are shown in the table below. These are in line with
the IT Assist SLA for incident management.

It should be noted that target resolution time is based on the priority of the incident reported but that
the actual resolution time may vary depending on the nature of the problem and the required solution.

| Priority | Response time | Resolution time |
| -------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| **P1** | 30 minutes | 4 hours or as agreed according to problem diagnosis |
| **P2** | 1 hour | 8 hours or as agreed according to problem diagnosis |
| **P3** | 2 hours | 1 day or as agreed according to problem diagnosis |
| **P4** | 4 hours | 5 working days or as agreed according to problem diagnosis |
| **P5** | 4 hours | to be agreed with the customer on a call by call basis |

When the incident has been resolved the call will be closed. When a call is closed the person who
raised the call will automatically receive an email from the Service Desk informing them that the
call has been closed. In most cases DSS will have already agreed with the customer that the problem
has been resolved to their satisfaction before the call is closed.

## Monitoring and Reporting

DSS will provide incident management reports (at a frequency to be agreed with the customer) that show
how incidents with the system have been dealt with in terms of resolution time and adherence to SLA targets.

The current IT Assist Service Desk Business Intelligence (BI) tool will be used to produce these reports.

Performance against agreed SLA targets will be disussed at regulare service review meetings (at a frequency
to be agreed with the customer) or by customer request.

## Change Management

Changes to an application or requests for new features must be requested through the IT Assist Service Desk.

Every request for change will be assessed at a high level in terms of size, complexity and potential
cost to the customer. At this stage, the assessment is purely indicative and of use only for prioritisation,
planning and budgetary purposes.

DSS will advise the customer when it will be possible to undertake the work associated with the proposed change
based on the current development and support workload and agreed pipeline of work.

## Escalation Procedure

Initially, any unresolved issue should be highlighted to DSS application support staff, giving full details
of the issue. It should be possible to resolve all issues at this stage.

If the customer is not satisfied with the response received, the issue should be escalated to the Service
Owner to discuss further. A full list of service owners can be found in the DSS Service Catalogue.

## Business Continuity Management

In the event of an emergency involving the implementation of a Business Continuity Plan that will affect the
service provided, DSS and the customer will consult each other with regards to the possible impact of their
Business Continuity Plans on the business of the other and each will assist the other where viability of the
plan depends upon mutual assistance.

## Prerequisites for on-boarding

In order for DSS to take over support of your application the following prerequisites must be met:

- there is a clearly identified Information Asset Owner (IAO)
- a Product Owner and Deputy have completed Product Owner training
- a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) has been carried out
- data is classified as Official
- the technology stack is currently supported
- details of the system are recorded on the NICS Central Register of Information Systems (CRIS)
- there is a valid business case
- all source code and configuration data is available

## Data Protection, Freedom of Information and Breach Management

General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) requires organisations which process personal data
to meet certain legal obligations.

The customer as the **Data Controller** must ensure that there is a lawful basis for collecting and
processing all personal data and must provide clear written instructions to the **Data Processor** (DSS).

The [ICO website][1] provides definitions of these two terms.

DSS, as the Data Processor, agrees to:

- to process personal data only on behalf of the customer, as the Data Controller and in compliance with its
written instructions (unless required by law to act with such instructions)
- to only engage sub-processors who can provide adequate assurances that they are compliant with the principles
of GDPR and with the prior consent of the customer, as the Data Controller, and a written contract or MOU
- store, manage and communicate personal data to the same level of confidentiality, integrity and availability
protection as the data owner i.e. the Department or other public sector organisation and in accordance with
its assessed business impact of a breach
- ensure that staff processing the data, including any contractors, are subject to a duty of confidence and that
all staff engaged by the processor or sub-processor in the management of such data must be cleared to the
required level as set by the customer as the Data Controller
- keep records of its processing activities in accordance with GDPR requirements
- assist the customer as the Data Controller in providing subject access requests and facilitating data
subjects to exercise their rights under the GDPR promptly so controllers can meet statutory deadlines
- assist the customer, as the Data Controller, in meeting its GDPR obligations in relation to the security
of processing, the notification of personal data breaches to allow reporting with 72 hours and data protection
impact assessments
- inform all controllers immediately if DSS, as Data Processor, decides to report itself for a data breach
- delete or return all personal data to the customer as the Data Controller as requested on the termination
of service
- to submit to audits and inspections, provide the customer, as the Data Controller, with whatever information
it needs to ensure that they are both meeting GDPR requirements
- to co-operate with supervisory authorities (such as the Information Commmissioner's Office) in accordance
with GDPR regulations required

The customer, as the Data Controller, is responsible for data protection and any data breach and will ensure
processes are in place to prevent breaches.

All FOI requests for customer data held on a system will be managed by the customer. Where an FOI request
is received from the customer which requires input or data from a system, this will be processed by DSS in a
timely manner in order to ensure that all standards and guidelines are adhered to.
